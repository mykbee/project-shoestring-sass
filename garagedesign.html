          <div class="column third">Access and Security
            <p>The garage has an access card that allows you to come and go as needed. Parking spaces can be accessed 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. This means that if you work late your space is still guaranteed. The month to month contract covers unrestricted use.</p>
            <p>The card reader and gate arm ensure access is available to only those with a valid parking card. Using state-of-the-art technology (card reader and a computer database), we can determine who is in the garage at any time.</p>
            <p>Stairwell exit doors are secured with combination pushpin locks. The locks are designed to keep non-tenants out of the garage. Please keep all doors closed and please don't give out the combination.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column third flow-opposite">Pricing
